• Yes. Once you buy plnr.zone, we can switch fully.

  Do this in order:

  1. Add plnr.zone in Netlify Domain management and set it as primary.
  2. Update DNS at registrar:

  - apex @ -> Netlify A/ALIAS records
  - www -> CNAME to Netlify target

  3. In Supabase Auth settings:

  - set Site URL to https://plnr.zone
  - add redirect URLs for:
      - https://plnr.zone
      - https://www.plnr.zone (if used)
      - http://localhost:3000 (dev)

  4. In Google OAuth (if enabled), add authorized origins/redirects for https://plnr.zone.
  5. Update local env:

  - REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL (same)
  - REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (same)
  - no domain env needed unless you hardcoded URLs.

  6. If using Resend custom email domain, add/verify DNS records (SPF/DKIM) for your sender domain.

  After that, all share links and auth flows will run on plnr.zone.

  Google will allow rxojshwdahyxyqewdiwy.supabase.co to access this info about you - cna we change it so i have a cuasotm name or no


• Yes, you can change that, but not fully from frontend.

  What you can brand:

  1. OAuth consent app name (Google side)

  - In Google Cloud OAuth consent screen, set app name to your brand (e.g. PLNR).
  - Users will then see your app name in the consent UI.

  2. Supabase hosted auth domain

  - By default it shows *.supabase.co.
  - To remove that domain from auth flows, use a custom auth domain in Supabase (if available on your plan/project features).
  - If custom auth domain isn’t available, the consent may still reference Supabase-hosted endpoints.

  3. Email branding

  - You can fully brand magic link emails via custom SMTP + templates (which you’re already moving toward with Resend).

  So:

  - App name shown to users: yes, easy (Google OAuth consent settings).
  - Replace ...supabase.co host in OAuth flow: only if Supabase custom auth domain is available for your setup.


› does supabase offer this form free account?


• Searched Supabase custom auth domain free plan availability

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Short answer: not on Free for a full custom domain.

  As of February 11, 2026, Supabase docs say:

  - Custom domains are a paid add-on and are available for projects on a paid plan.
  - Pricing is listed around $0.0137/hour (~$10/month) per active custom domain.

  Sources:

  - https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/custom-domains
  - https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/custom-domains

  Note: Supabase also mentions vanity *.supabase.co subdomains (experimental) as a cheaper/free-ish alternative depending on eligibility, but that still won’t be your own
  domain.


› is it better to move to aws? i also would like to build mobile apps for this


• Searched Supabase React Native authentication docs

• Searched Supabase docs React Native quickstart auth expo

• Searched Supabase React Native quickstart auth Expo

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Short answer: No, don’t move to AWS now just for mobile.

  For your current stage, staying on Supabase is the pragmatic choice:

  - Supabase has first-party React Native/Expo auth quickstarts and social auth docs.
  - You can use deep links for mobile auth callbacks.
  - You already built your web app around Supabase auth/data, so reusing backend is faster than replatforming.

  When AWS is better:

  - strict enterprise compliance controls
  - heavy multi-account AWS governance
  - very custom infra requirements your team already runs in AWS

  For you right now:

  1. Keep Supabase backend.
  2. Build mobile with Expo + Supabase client.
  3. Reassess only after traction/scale.
